            Mama was queen of the mambo
            Papa was king of the Congo
            Deep down in the jungle
            I started bangin' my first bongo

            I went to the big town
            Where there is a lot of sound
            From the jungle to the city
            Looking for a bigger crown

            I'm the "king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"

            I'm a king without a crown
            Hanging loose in a big town

            They say that I'm a clown
            Making too much dirty sound
            They say there is no place for little monkey in this town
